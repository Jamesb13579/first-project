            <h2 id="about">About The Author</h2>
            <p>I'm just an ordinary guy (you know?) who decided to write a book.</p>
            <p>Years passed.</p>
            <p>In March 2013, I sat down and read a whole bunch of zombie books (and listened to the audiobooks of a ton
                more.) The result, after a few twists and turns, is the increasingly global series Surviving The
                Evacuation.</p>
            <p>Book 1 began as a journal, written by an unnamed survivor, found in the ruins, a decade after the
                outbreak. The story evolved, the journal grew and morphed into a series that tells the story of an
                outbreak, the political response to it, and a decades old conspiracy.</p>
            <p>The series continues, with new characters, in Book 4: Unsafe Haven & Book 5: Reunion. These novels move
                away from the political theme, and focus on survival, betrayal and the hope for a new life. They are the
                story of Nilda and her son Jay, as they struggle through the early days of the outbreak in search of
                somewhere, anywhere, that is safe.</p>
            <p>Nilda, Jay, Chester and Tuck's story concludes in Book 6: Harvest and Book 7: Home, . Both novels are set
                in and around the Tower of London, and deal with the everyday struggles of life in an undead world,
                betrayal, and the final end to the conspiracy that brought about the end of our world.</p>
            <p>This was going to be the end to the series, but due to popular demand, it continues in Here We Stand 1:
                Infected & 2: Divided, the story of Sholto, the outbreak, and how he tried to stop the conspiracy behind
                it.</p>
            <p>Bill et al return in Book 8: Anglesey: Eight months after the outbreak, humanity has been reduced to a
                few thousand souls. With this realisation begins the struggle to ensure that the species itself doesn't
                become extinct.</p>
            <p>Work Rest Repeat is set within a quasi-dystopian city, one of only three to survive The Great Disaster
                some sixty years before. The 120,000 survivors are working, and have been for the past six decades, on
                constructing colony ships to evacuate this last remnant of humanity to Mars. It was a desperate plan,
                but one that seems to be have worked. A launch date has been set. A lottery is to be held to choose the
                first colonists but, with only twenty-four hours before the election, two murders threaten to disrupt
                humanityâ€™s plans.</p>
            <p>Strike a Match: a transatlantic thriller set in a world of rationing and ruins, democracy and despotism,
                steam trains and smart phones. This isn't the story of how the apocalypse is survived, but of what
                happens next.</p>
